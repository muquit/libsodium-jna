Notes to myself. I always forget how to publish to maven central...
There are two ways to publish

* Old legacy way - https://oss.sonatype.org/
* New - https://central.sonatype.org/

These two systems are not compatible. New method requires to have a 'namespace'. As com.muquit
is a registered namespace at https://oss.sonatype.org/, it cannot be used without migrating. 
Therefore, I will keep using old for the time being

* Login to https://oss.sonatype.org/
  - Click on login name -> Profile from upper right corner
  - Summary -> User Token
  - Click on "Access User Token"
  - Copy the <server></server> block
  - Create/Update ~/.m2/settings.xml

  <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                          https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
     <servers>
      <server>
        <id>ossrh</id>
        <username>username from user token</username>
        <password>password from user token</password>
       </server>
     </servers>
   </settings>


* Set the env var MY_GPG_PASSPHRASE

* Publish to staging repo
  ./install_release.sh
  ./publish.sh

* Login to https://oss.sonatype.org/
  - Click on 'Staging Repositories'
    - Find the newly created repo
    - 'Close' the staging repo
      - if all checks pass, 'Release' the repo

The project will show up on https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ almost 
instantly but will take 2 to many ours to show up on https://search.maven.org  due to 
indexing delay.
