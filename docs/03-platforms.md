# Supported platforms

In theory it should work on any platform where native libsodium library works and JVM 1.7+ is available.

The implementation is tested on the following platforms with libsodium v1.0.15 - v1.0.19 with JVM 1.7, 1.8 and  [jdk11](https://jdk.java.net/11/)

| Platform | JVM |
|----------|-----|
| 64 bit Windows 7 and 10 | 64 bit JVM |
| 64 bit MacOS X running Sierra and El Capitan | 64 bit JVM |
| 64 bit Linux | 64 bit JVM |
| 32 bit Linux | 32 bit JVM |
| It is reported that it works on 32 bit Windows but I personally did not test that| 32 bit JVM |
